| Module | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[`/contracts`](./contracts)** | The on-chain settlement layer (`Solidity`, `Hardhat`). |
| **[`/loop`](./loop)** | The off-chain verification engine, structured as a set of packages. |
| **[`/demo`](./demo)** | Frontend proofs-of-concept (`Next.js`). |
| **[`/docs`](./docs)** | System architecture diagrams and documentation. |

### Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**
-   [**Task**](https://taskfile.dev/installation/)
-   [**Bun**](https://bun.sh/)

**1. Install Dependencies**
This command installs all dependencies for all workspaces (`sdk`, `records`, `rewards`, `demo`).

```bash
task project:install
```

**2. Build Local Packages**
This command builds the local packages (like the SDK) that are dependencies for other services.

```bash
task project:build
```

**3. Setup the Database**
This is a one-time command to initialize the database schema and populate it with seed data.

```bash
task records:setup
```

**4. Run the Backend**
This command starts the backend API services.

```bash
task loop:start
```

The `records` API server will now be running and accessible.
