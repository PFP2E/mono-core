# PFP2E Protocol
### Verifiable Visual Identity Â· Programmable Rewards

</div>

---

### PFP2E is a hybrid on-chain/off-chain protocol for verifying visual identity and linking it to a trustless reward system. This repository contains the reference implementation built for the ETHGlobal hackathon.

### Design Philosophy: Pragmatic Simplicity
This project was built in a constrained, hackathon environment. We prioritized a clean, working, end-to-end demo over feature-completeness. The architecture is intentionally simple, the contracts are minimal, and the code is written for clarity.

---

### Local Development
The project uses a containerized environment managed by **[Task](https://taskfile.dev/)** and **Docker**. This provides a consistent, reproducible workflow.

**Prerequisites:**
-   Docker
-   [Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) (`brew install go-task/tap/go-task`)

To run a module, navigate to its directory (e.g., `cd demo`) and use the `task` commands:

```bash
# Start the development server
task dev

# Run the test suite
task test
```

### Repository Guide
This repository is a monorepo organized by domain.
