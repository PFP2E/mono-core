PFP2E is a hybrid on-chain/off-chain protocol for verifying visual identity and linking it to a trustless reward system. This repository contains the reference implementation of the system, structured as a professional monorepo.

## System Architecture

The system is composed of two primary layers: an **Off-Chain Loop** for data processing and an **On-Chain Layer** for settlement.

### Monorepo Structure

This repository is a monorepo managed by **[Bun](https://bun.sh/)** and **[Task](https://taskfile.dev/)**.

| Module | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[`/contracts`](./contracts)** | The on-chain settlement layer, built with Solidity and Hardhat. |
| **[`/loop`](./loop)** | The off-chain verification engine, structured as a set of services. |
| **[`/demo`](./demo)** | Frontend proofs-of-concept, built with Next.js. |
| **[`/docs`](./docs)** | System architecture diagrams and documentation. |

### Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**
-   [**Task**](https://taskfile.dev/installation/)
-   [**Bun**](https://bun.sh/)

**1. Bootstrap the Project**
This is the only command you need to run for a first-time setup. It will install all dependencies across the monorepo.

```bash
task bootstrap
```

**2. Run the Services**
The off-chain system requires two services running in separate terminals:

*   **Terminal 1: Start the Records API**
    ```bash
    task records:prod
    ```
*   **Terminal 2: Run the Rewards Oracle**
    (Ensure your `.env` file is configured in `/loop/rewards`)
    ```bash
    task rewards:prod
    ```
