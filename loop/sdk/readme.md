# Package: `@pfp2e/sdk`

> Shared utilities, types, and a generated API client for the `/loop` services.

This library is a shared internal package that provides consistent, reusable code to all other backend services.

### Core Exports

-   **`@pfp2e/sdk/types`**: Shared TypeScript interfaces (e.g., `Campaign`) that define the data contracts used across the backend.
