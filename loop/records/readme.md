| **Output** | A verification status via the API and a new record in the `verifications` table upon success. |

### API Endpoints
-   `GET /v1/campaigns`: Lists all available campaigns.
-   `GET /v1/campaigns/:id`: Fetches details for a single campaign.
-   `POST /v1/verify`: Submits a user for verification against a campaign.
