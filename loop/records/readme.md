# Service: `@pfp2e/records`

> The "Ground Truth" database service for the PFP2E protocol.

This service owns the SQLite database and exposes it via a clean REST API. It is the single source of truth for all off-chain data, including campaign definitions, the canonical set of valid PFP hashes, and the list of reward-eligible participants.

### API Endpoints
The API is fully documented using OpenAPI. When the service is running, an interactive Swagger UI is available.
