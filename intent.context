# Session Debrief: Project Complete

## Objective Achieved
The primary objective—to integrate the on-chain settlement layer (`@pfp2e/contracts`) with the off-chain data services (`@pfp2e/loop`)—is complete. We have successfully created a single, cohesive, and demonstrable end-to-end system.

## Final State Assessment
The project is now a fully realized, professional MVP that clearly demonstrates the core value proposition of the PFP2E protocol.

1.  **On-Chain Layer (`@pfp2e/contracts`):**
    *   **State:** Complete and robust.
    *   **Assets:** A production-ready, epoch-based `MerkleDistributor` contract, fully tested and documented.

2.  **Off-Chain Layer (`@pfp2e/loop`):**
    *   **State:** A clean, professional, and well-documented oracle architecture.
    *   **Assets:**
        *   `@pfp2e/records`: A standalone API server that acts as the "ground truth" database, serving a clean OpenAPI spec.
        *   `@pfp2e/sdk`: A shared library with a generated, type-safe client for the `records` API.
        *   `@pfp2e/rewards`: A robust "epoch oracle" with a clear, single-responsibility design. It consumes data from the `records` API, performs verification, and settles the results on-chain by calling the smart contract.

## Key Accomplishments
- **Full End-to-End Integration**: The off-chain oracle now successfully and reliably communicates with the on-chain contract.
- **Professional Code Quality**: The oracle's codebase has been refactored for maximum clarity, with isolated business logic and comprehensive JSDoc comments, making it easy for judges to review.
- **Robustness & Stability**: All known bugs, including ABI mismatches and checksum errors, have been resolved. The system is stable and predictable.
- **Polished Documentation**: All README files have been updated to reflect the final architecture, providing a clear and accurate guide to the project.

The project is now in a "pencils down" state, ready for submission.
